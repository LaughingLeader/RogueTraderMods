This is a collection of various mods for the game [Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/).

Currently a work-in-progress.

## More Info  

A tiny mod that adds some options for displaying more information. 

Currently includes:

| Option | Description |
| :---         | :---         |
| Show Initiative Rolls | Shows all initiative rolls in the combat log, when combat starts. |
| Dialog - Show All Answers | Shows all answers in dialog, regardless of requirements. |
| Dialog - Show Previously Selected Answers | More of a debug option, but this makes selected answers show up as possible options again. |

## LeaderTweaks  

Various quality-of-life options, fixes, and cheats.

### Relentless Blaze  

| Option | Description |
| :---         | :---         |
| Automatically Apply Warp Burn / Orchestrate Flames | Automatically self-buffs on combat start. This is a bit of a cheat, but personally I was getting tired of always having to do this in every combat, to get the +1 psy rating. |
| No Burning Damage | This makes Burning/Warp Burn deal 0 damage if the character has the Relentless Blaze. More of a way to cut down on log spam, but this can be considered a cheat as well, if you haven't mitigated the damage already. |

### Max Party Size  

You can set the max party size. This affects the recruitment screen as well, so it's possible to have the game always bring all your companions with you.

### Fixes  

#### Pain Channeling  

The Pain Channeling talent damages you when killing the last enemy in combat, which can eventually cause you to always take trauma or an injury, once your damage starts ramping up. This option makes this self damage from Pain Channeling always 0.

### Cheats  

#### Always Pass Non-Combat Skill / Attribute Checks  

Self-explanatory. These can be set individually, and they work even if the chance was initially 0%.
